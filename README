README SHA256 and HMAC_SHA256 for embedded systems and standalone apps
=======================================================================

This is mjt-sha256/mjt-hmac-sha256.

The implementation of SHA256/HMAC-SHA256 used in several of my projects is
technically owned by Applie Inc. and covered via a stange license.

This version was written and tested by myself in conjunction with ChatGPT
and uses only public and open source contributions.

Both are written in clean, procedural C11, with no silly CamelCase variable
names, etc. and compile with GCC using -Wall (Warnings: all).

Both modules have unit tests in the associated xxxxx_test.c that use NIST
recommended values and both pass tests.


SHA256
------

The SHA256 source is a single module comprising sha256.c and sha256.h and
has the same calling conventions as the Apple/RKW version.

Making, using and testing:

   mike@orac:~/mjt-sha256$ cc -o sha256_test sha256_test.c sha256.c
   mike@orac:~/mjt-sha256$ ./sha256_test
   ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad
   SHA256 selftest passed (3 tests)
   mike@orac:~/mjt-sha256$



HMAC-SHA256
-----------

The HMAC-SHA256 source is a single module comprising hmac_sha256.c and
hmac_sha256.h and has DIFFERENT callsing conventions to the previous version
which was modified by me anyway.

The new calling convention is:

   hmac_sha255(uint8_t *out, uint8_t *key, size_t keylen, uint8_t *data, size_t datalen)


Making, using and testing:

   mike@orac:~/mjt-sha256$ cc -o hmac_sha256_test hmac_sha256_test.c hmac_sha256.c sha256.c
   mike@orac:~/mjt-sha256$ ./hmac_sha256_test
   f7bc83f430538424b13298e6aa6fb143ef4d59a14946175997479dbc2d1a3cd8
   HMAC-SHA256 selftest passed (3 tests)
